# pascal

This is a simplified version of pascal interpreter.
In the fisrt iteratin was implemented:
    architechture for simple implementation built in types, operators (including logical) and functions 
    every type and operator from c++ can be easily transfered by addition it into DefaultOperatorManager, using type traits of BuiltInOperations.h file
    basic interpretier with arythmetics, if-then-else condition and input/output

There is a code example in file input

In second iteration was done:
    cycles implemented
    custom functions
    added more operators for built in types
